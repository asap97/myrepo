# myrepo
Repository for testing my Git/GitHub setup

this is a new line

Class notes 

Git works line by line, so every time you change a line Git notices it 

-Q: difference between commit and push? If you commit locally and push once, do you save all previous commits?

Idk what I just did but apparently created a new branch yeii

I guess this is a Pull

Copy of someone else's repository is called a fork. Then you create a local version of this,
copying the URL and creating it as usual. You now have a local fork. You make changes here and
then push them to your personal copy in github and it will recognise and ask if 
you would like to have the changes in the original project and allow you to 
write and send a request into the original repository, and then they can decide 
if they do want to merge the changes.
